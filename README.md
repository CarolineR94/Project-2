### Aim:
to create a photo sharing website similar to Instagram as a second project on the GA WDI course.


### Technologies used:
* HTML
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Materialize
* Git & GitHub


### The site:
An imitation of instagram. Functionality includes logging in and out, adding, deleting and updating photos, adding and deleting comments, and updating user details.

### The process:
1. Wireframing - Balsamiq and by hand
2. Created file structure
3. Set up authentication
4. Created photo model, routes and controller, then added the same for users.
5. Added comment model to allow users to comment on photos.
6. Final styling of the site in addition to Materialize framework.


### Issues faced:
* Adding the comment feature and allowing users to delete only their own comments.


### Future plans:
* File upload for photos rather than via URL, using Filestack.
